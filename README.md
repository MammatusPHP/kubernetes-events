# Events

This package provides the following events:

## Helm/Values

This event is emitted when the Helm chart is being templated/installed/etc and is used to pass data to Helm to
render the Chart and any additional subcharts. It has one property, the registry, and anything you add into it using
the `add` method will be returned through the `get` method and passed directly to Helm.

```php
$values = new Values(new Values\Registry(Values\ValuesFile::createFromFile('path/to/helm/chart/values.yaml'));

$values->registry->add('secion', ['PHP_INT_SIZE' => PHP_INT_SIZE]);

$values->registry->get()); // Returns: ['secion' => ['PHP_INT_SIZE' => PHP_INT_SIZE]]
```
